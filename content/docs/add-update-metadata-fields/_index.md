## CKAN DCAT Model

When a schema change falls under DCAT-AP 3 or an earlier version of DCAT-AP but is not yet present, follow these steps:


1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-dcat
   ```
2. **Add the new field to the schema:**
- Modify the schema file:
<ckanext/dcat/schemas/dcat_ap_full.yaml>
- Use appropriate field types (e.g., text, repeating subfield, URI).
- Follow examples from other fields for consistency.
For more information about scheming can be found [here](../ckan/scheming/_index.md)

3. **Extend the existing mapping depending on the DCAT-AP version:**
Modify the mapping files located in the directory:
<ckanext/dcat/profiles>
4. **Fix the corresponding unit tests:**
5. **Create a pull request to the CKAN DCAT extension repository.**
Ensure that you follow the contributing guidelines for CKAN:
- Include unit tests for the new fields.
- Ensure compatibility across different DCAT-AP versions.
6. **Update the following repositories after a new release:**
Update development and production Dockerfiles in these repositories( order is important):
- https://github.com/GenomicDataInfrastructure/gdi-userportal-ckanext-fairdatapoint
- https://github.com/GenomicDataInfrastructure/gdi-userportal-ckan-docker
Check if ckan locally works with the new added fields by harvesting an example FDP 

### Example of new field ### 
An example of a missing mapping in CKAN DCAT can be found here:  
[Multi-valued field creator in CKAN DCAT](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-dcat/pull/302).

> **Note:** Always take into account the mapping from CKAN → DCAT in addition to DCAT → CKAN.

## Solr Search Integration
If you're adding a new field in CKAN and you want it to be searchable via Solr, follow these steps to modify the `schema.xml` file.

### Steps to Add and Configure a Searchable Field

1. **Defining the Field Type and Name**  
   In the top part of the `schema.xml` file, define the type and name of the new field. The type specifies how Solr will handle the data in the field (e.g., as `text`, `integers`, `dates`, etc.).

   - Navigate to the section in `schema.xml` where other fields are defined.
   - Add your new field with its corresponding type.

   Example:
     ```xml
     <field name="custom_field" type="string" indexed="true" stored="true" />
     ```
    Here, custom_field is the name of the field, and it's set as a string type. It is also indexed (which makes it searchable) and stored (so it can be returned in search results).

2. **Adding the Field to Search**
    In the lower part of the schema.xml file, you'll need to add this field to the list of fields that are searchable by Solr. This is typically done in a section that defines which fields are indexed for searches.
    Example:
     ```xml
     <copyField source="custom_field" dest="text" />
     ```
    This example maps the custom_field to the text field, which Solr uses for full-text searches. By adding the copyField directive, you're instructing Solr to include the contents of custom_field in the search index
3. **When finished. Release a new version and update**
    When finished. Release a new version and update GitHub - GenomicDataInfrastructure/gdi-userportal-ckan-docker: Scripts and images to run CKAN using Docker Compose  in the development and production dockerfile 

#### Notes

##### Indexing vs Storing:
- **indexed="true"**: The field can be used in searches.
- **stored="true"**: The field can be retrieved in search results.

##### Testing the Configuration:
After making these changes, you should restart your Solr instance and reindex your CKAN data to ensure that the new field is indexed and searchable with the command:

```bash
ckan -c /etc/ckan/default/ckan.ini search-index rebuild
```

## [SeMPyRO](https://github.com/Health-RI/SeMPyRO)

### Prerequisites
Fields are easy to add to SeMPyRO. You’ll need to know a few things:
- The **predicate** of the field
- **Cardinality** (single or multiple-valued)
- **Range** or datatype

### Adding a Field
Once that’s identified, go to the relevant class and add a property as follows. Here’s an example of the `type` property of `HRI_Dataset`:

```python
type: List[AnyHttpUrl] = Field(
    default=None,
    description="The nature or genre of the resource. HRI recommended",
    rdf_term=DCTERMS.type,
    rdf_type="uri")
```

At **Line 1**, we see `type`, which is the name of the property. Its range is an `AnyHttpUrl`, which is a helper for any URL. Other examples of this are `LiteralField` or sometimes even classes like `Agent` or `VCard`. It is multi-valued because it's in a `List`. If the maximum cardinality is one, it should not be in a `List`.

At **Line 2**, `default=None` indicates the field is optional and by default undefined. Leave this line out for mandatory fields.

At **Line 3**, we have a human-readable description of the field.

At **Line 4**, we define the predicate. In this case, it's `dcterms:type`. Some common namespaces, like `DCTERMS` and `DCAT`, are imported by default. A full URI can also be defined, for example with `URIRef("http://example.com/range#property")`.

At **Line 5**, we define the RDF type. There are many possible values here, such as `rdfs_literal`, `xsd:string`, or `uri`. It's recommended to take a look at other properties to understand what is necessary here.

Once this is done, the JSON and YAML schemas need to be re-generated. For the `HRIDataset` class, this can be done by running the following command:

```bash
hatch run python sempyro/hri_dcat/hri_dataset
```

## FAIR Data Point

For the technical point of view, updating the appropriate **SHACL shapes** allows for adding of fields.

### Steps to Add a Field in FDP:

1. In the FDP, log in as an admin user and go to the **Metadata schemas** option.
2. Select the resource to update (e.g. **Catalog**).
3. In the **Form Definition** textarea, add a new entry in the list of `sh:property` values. For example:

```bash
[
  sh:path my:new-property ;      # the predicate IRI
  sh:nodeKind sh:Literal ;       # the value type
  sh:minCount 1 ;                # cardinality
  dash:viewer dash:LiteralViewer ;  # UI hint for displaying
  dash:editor dash:TextFieldEditor ; # UI hint for editing
]
```
4. Click **Save** if this is a draft and needs further work, or **Save and release** if the work is done.
5. Add a description and select a version number.
6. Click **Release**.

## Discovery Service

The **Dataset Discovery** service requires two parts to be updated: the **OpenAPI definitions** and the **mapping**.

### OpenAPI Definition

Two definitions need to be updated, both located in the `src/main/openapi` folder: 
- **ckan.yaml**: This file contains the API returned by CKAN. Based on this YAML, Java classes are automatically generated corresponding to the API definition. For adding a field to a **Dataset**, the primary change will likely be in the **CkanPackage** definition. See the examples there on how to add a property.
- **discovery.yaml**: This file defines what the Discovery service should return. You can make this definition whatever you want it to be—it does not have to correspond one-to-one with CKAN. To add a property here, modify the **RetrievedDataset** definition. Again, see the examples in the file.

### Mapping



Once you have changed the definitions, follow these steps:
1. Run the following command:

```bash
mvn clean compile
```
