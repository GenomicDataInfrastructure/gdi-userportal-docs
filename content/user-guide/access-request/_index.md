## 3. Request Access

The **Request Access** functionality in the GDI Portal allows users to formally request permission to access genomic datasets that are restricted for a variety of reasons, including privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions. Many datasets in the portal require prior approval before access is granted. This section will guide you through the process of requesting access, managing your applications, and monitoring their status.

### 3.1 Adding Datasets to the Basket

Once you've identified datasets that are relevant to your research or project, you can add them to your **Basket**. The Basket acts as a holding area where you can gather and organize datasets before proceeding with the access request process. This feature is particularly helpful if you're considering multiple datasets and would like to submit a single application for all of them, saving you time and effort.

You can add any number of datasets to the Basket, and once you're ready, you can proceed with creating your application to request access to these datasets.

### 3.2 Creating an Application

To begin the process of requesting access to datasets, follow these steps:

1. **Log in to your GDI Portal account.** Only logged-in users can submit applications.
2. **Navigate to your Basket** where the datasets you have added are stored.
3. Click on the **Create Application** button to start a new access request.
4. Choose the datasets from your Basket that you want to include in the application.
5. Your application will be saved in **Draft** status, which allows you to review and modify it before submission.

Once your application is ready, you can submit it for review. But before submission, ensure that all required fields are filled out and that the relevant documentation is attached.

### 3.3 Application Statuses

Applications undergo several stages as they move through the approval process. The following are the key application statuses:

- **Draft**: Your application is being prepared and can be modified. This is the initial status where you can add information, attach documents, and edit the application.
- **Submitted**: The application has been sent for review and cannot be edited further. This marks the official submission of your request to the dataset provider.
- **Approved**: The application has been approved, granting you access to the requested datasets. You will be notified, and you can begin retrieving the data.
- **Rejected**: The application has been declined, and feedback may be provided regarding the reasons for the rejection. You can use this feedback to improve future applications.

Each application status is updated in real-time on your **Applications Page**, so you can always keep track of where your request stands.

### 3.4 Completing the Application Form

Once your application is in **Draft** status, you will need to fill out all necessary details before submitting it. While the required information can vary depending on the dataset provider, typical requirements include:

- **Additional Documentation**: Some datasets may require supplementary documents, such as ethics approval or data access agreements. These are typically requested for sensitive datasets that involve human or clinical data.
- **Acceptance of Terms**: You must agree to the terms and conditions set by the dataset provider. This is often a legal agreement ensuring responsible use of the data, including adherence to privacy regulations and ethical standards.

Remember, specific instructions and required fields will be presented on the application details page, so be sure to follow them closely to ensure your application is complete.

### 3.5 Collaborating on an Application

The GDI Portal provides the ability to collaborate with other users on an application. Once you've created your application, you can invite others to join and contribute by adding them as participants. To do so, simply click on the **Add Participant** button on the application details page.

Collaborators can view the application, provide input, and help complete any missing details. This is especially useful for research teams or projects that involve multiple contributors. All participants added to the application will have access to the same details, ensuring everyone involved is on the same page. The collaboration feature makes the request process more efficient and transparent, allowing for better teamwork on dataset access requests.

### 3.6 Tracking and Managing Applications

After creating and submitting your application, you can track its progress from the **Applications Page**. This centralized location lets you:

- View all active and past applications in one place.
- Check the current status of each application to see if it's in **Draft**, **Submitted**, **Approved**, or **Rejected**.
- Receive notifications if additional documentation is required or if your application needs further attention.
- Access datasets directly from the portal once your application has been approved.
