## Agenda
- Refinement of User Portal integration with Beacon Network:
  - Minimum viable feature to implement in User Portal
  - Query endpoint of Beacon Network
  - Variables endpoint to build beacon queries
  - Minimum authorisation setup for querying on Beacon Network
  - Understanding on how to read beacon network output

## Agreements
- Advanced querying features are out of scope of User Portal.
- User Portal will perform a basic dataset listing query with Beacon Network.
- Beacon Query consent is out of scope for Milestone 7.
- On the following week a workshop between User Portal and Beacon developers will be held.

## Assumptions
- OIDC between Beacon Network and User Portal should work via common IdP access token (LS-AAI).
- REMS issues passports and visas to LS-AAI.
