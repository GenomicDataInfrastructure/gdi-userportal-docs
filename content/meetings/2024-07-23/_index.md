## Agenda
- Technical discussion with Beacon Network and LS-AAI product owners on how to implement Terms&Conditions

## Agreements
- WP04 must align with 1+MG coordination on all legal documents and requirements for LNDS to serve as the temporary host.
- LNDS, as the temporary host, must provide a document for the Terms & Conditions. It must be publicly available, and its URL will be used as the value for the GA4GH visa.
- Once this document is provided, LS-AAI will set up a Terms & Conditions form for user acceptance.
- Acceptance of these Terms & Conditions is translated into a group in LS-AAI and into a GA4GH visa.
- User Portal must look for that visa for pre-validation and acceptance requests.
- Beacon Network, given the confirmation of 1+MG requirements, will implement the same Terms & Conditions workflow.
- Beacons, given the confirmation of 1+MG requirements, must implement GA4GH visa validation.
