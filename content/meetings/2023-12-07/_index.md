## Agenda
* Progress on Tasks 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3

## Agreements
* Ensure we are going to expose OpenAPI contract for any component we develop for User Portal.
* User Portal must be deployed under `*.onemilliongenomes.eu`.
* For now, there is no requirement on where the User Portal will be deployed, we keep it on Elixir LU.
* A design document must be produced, to share details on metadata model to be consumed by User Portal.
* We need to open discussions on how Beacon Network will provide agregated output.
* We need to improve the application architecture to provide mode details on technologies, and responsibilities.

## Action points
* Document CKAN API on gdi-userportal-docs
* Discuss on how we can use `*.onemilliongenomes.eu`
* Define deployment environments for User Portal
* Expose Synthetic data from Starter Kit to be harvested by User Portal
* Update application architecture to add diagrams and more details on AuthN / AuthZ.
* Start discussions on minimum metadata model for User Portal
* Start discussions on Aggregated Output from Beacon Network
